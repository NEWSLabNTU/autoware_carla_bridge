# Project Meta Information

This document provides an overview of the autoware_carla_bridge project, including goals, success criteria, risk management, and progress tracking.

---

## Project Overview

**Current State**: `zenoh_carla_bridge` uses Zenoh to bridge CARLA simulator data to ROS 2 systems through multiple modes (DDS, ROS2, RmwZenoh).

**Target State**: `autoware_carla_bridge` will use rclrs to publish CARLA data directly as native ROS 2 topics, eliminating the need for intermediate bridges.

**Timeline**: Estimated 4-6 weeks for complete migration and testing.

## Migration Goals

- ‚úÖ Replace Zenoh with native ROS 2 communication (rclrs)
- ‚úÖ Maintain compatibility with Autoware 2025.22
- ‚úÖ Simplify codebase by removing bridge-specific logic
- ‚úÖ Improve type safety with compile-time message type checking
- ‚úÖ Achieve comparable or better performance
- ‚úÖ Provide comprehensive testing and documentation

## Prerequisites

Before starting the migration, ensure:

- [ ] CARLA 0.9.15 is installed and working
- [ ] ROS 2 Humble is installed
- [ ] Autoware 2025.22 is installed (for ROS message types)
- [ ] Rust toolchain is configured (rustc, cargo)
- [ ] LLVM/Clang 12 is installed for CARLA Rust bindings
- [ ] `carla_agent` vehicle spawning tool is working
- [ ] `external/autoware` symlink points to Autoware installation
- [ ] Familiarity with both Zenoh and rclrs APIs (see `docs/zenoh-to-rclrs-api-comparison.md`)

---

## Success Criteria

The migration is considered successful when:

### Functional Requirements
- ‚úÖ All sensor types publish to ROS 2 topics (Camera, LiDAR, IMU, GNSS)
- ‚úÖ Vehicle control works bidirectionally (status out, commands in)
- ‚úÖ Multiple vehicles can be bridged simultaneously
- ‚úÖ Clock synchronization works correctly
- ‚úÖ Integration with Autoware 2025.22 is functional

### Technical Requirements
- ‚úÖ Zero Zenoh dependencies remain
- ‚úÖ All ROS 2 topics use correct message types
- ‚úÖ QoS profiles are appropriate for each topic type
- ‚úÖ No CDR serialization code remains
- ‚úÖ Code passes `make lint` with no warnings
- ‚úÖ Code is formatted with `make format`

### Performance Requirements
- ‚úÖ Topic publication rates match or exceed Zenoh version
- ‚úÖ CPU usage is comparable or better
- ‚úÖ Memory usage is stable (no leaks)
- ‚úÖ Latency is acceptable for real-time control

### Documentation Requirements
- ‚úÖ README.md accurately describes the project
- ‚úÖ API documentation is complete
- ‚úÖ Migration guide helps Zenoh users transition
- ‚úÖ Examples and tutorials are working

### Testing Requirements
- ‚úÖ All integration tests pass
- ‚úÖ Autoware integration is verified
- ‚úÖ Long-running stability test completes
- ‚úÖ Error handling is robust

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Autoware message types unavailable in Rust | High | Medium | Generate from `.msg` files or use CDR temporarily |
| Performance regression vs. Zenoh | Medium | Low | Profile and optimize hot paths |
| rclrs API limitations | Medium | Low | Engage with ros2-rust community |
| Breaking changes during development | Medium | Medium | Use feature branch, frequent testing |
| CARLA API incompatibilities | Low | Low | Keep CARLA version pinned |

### Contingency Plans

- **If Autoware messages unavailable**:
  - Option 1: Generate Rust bindings using rosidl
  - Option 2: Define structs manually and use CDR
  - Option 3: Contribute message generation to ros2-rust project

- **If performance issues**:
  - Profile with flamegraph
  - Consider `MultiThreadedExecutor`
  - Optimize message copying
  - Use `Arc` more aggressively

- **If rclrs bugs found**:
  - Report to ros2-rust GitHub
  - Fork and patch if critical
  - Consider temporary workarounds
