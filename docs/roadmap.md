## Document Overview

### [Meta Information](roadmap/meta.md)
- Project overview and target state
- Migration goals
- Prerequisites
- Success criteria (functional, technical, performance, documentation, testing)
- Risk management and contingency plans
- Progress tracking and metrics

### [Architecture Design](roadmap/architecture.md)
- 1-to-1 Autoware-centric design philosophy
- Core principles:
  1. One bridge per vehicle
  2. Bridge is passive adapter
  3. Root namespace topics
  4. Vehicle discovery and selection
- Revised startup sequence (9 steps)
- Multi-vehicle simulation example
- Alternative designs considered
- Consequences and trade-offs
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**:
  - ADR-001: 1-to-1 Bridge-Vehicle Mapping
  - ADR-002: Bridge Does Not Control Simulation
  - ADR-003: Root Namespace Topics

### [Core Migration](roadmap/core-migration.md) - ‚úÖ COMPLETE
Completed phases covering the foundation of the migration:
- **Phase 0**: Development environment setup, codebase analysis, documentation
- **Phase 1**: Zenoh to rclrs migration, dependency updates, mode removal
- **Phase 2**: Clock publisher migration and runtime verification

### [Feature Implementation](roadmap/feature-implementation.md) - ‚è≥ PENDING
Pending phases for completing bridge functionality:
- **Phase 3**: Sensor bridges (Camera, LiDAR, IMU, GNSS)
- **Phase 4**: Vehicle control subscribers and status publishers
- **Phase 5**: Integration testing, performance optimization, code quality
- **Phase 6**: Documentation updates, migration guide, release preparation

### [Enhancements](roadmap/enhancements.md) - üîÑ IN PROGRESS / PLANNED
Enhancement phases for improved functionality and architecture:
- **Phase 7** (IN PROGRESS): carla-rust integration
  - Actor cleanup with destroy()
  - Efficient world loading
  - Debug data recording
  - Multi-version CARLA support
  - Advanced API exploration
- **Phase 8** (PLANNED): Architecture refactoring for 1-to-1 design
  - Remove simulation control
  - Add vehicle selection CLI
  - Simplify actor management
  - Root namespace topics
  - Vehicle respawn handling
  - Main loop refactoring
  - Scenario scripts
  - Testing and validation
  - TF publisher (optional)
